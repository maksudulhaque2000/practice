## üéØ About This Project

This repository serves as a personal playground and a structured collection of my learning journey in software development. The primary goals are:

-   **Skill Enhancement:** To practice and hone my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) by solving problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
-   **Learning New Technologies:** To experiment with new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries in a controlled environment.
-   **Version Control Mastery:** To master the Git & GitHub workflow, including branching, merging, and handling conflicts.
-   **Code Synchronization:** To maintain a single source of truth for all my practice files, accessible from any of my development machines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This repository contains code written in various languages and technologies, including but not limited to:

-   **Languages:** `Python`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Java`, `C++`
-   **Frontend:** `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `React`, `Vue.js`
-   **Backend:** `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `Django`
-   **Databases:** `SQL`, `MongoDB`
-   **Tools:** `Git`, `Docker`

## üìÅ Folder Structure

To keep the repository organized and easy to navigate, I follow a consistent folder structure. A typical layout is as follows:

## üöÄ My Personal Workflow

This section outlines the standard workflow I follow to keep my local and remote repositories in sync.

### 1. Clone the Repository (One-time setup)
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```
### 2. Sync Before Starting Work
Before starting a new practice session, I always pull the latest changes from the remote main branch to avoid conflicts.
```bash
git pull origin main
```
### 3. Commit and Push Changes
After making changes or adding new files, I commit them with a descriptive message and push them to GitHub.
```bash
# Stage all changes for commit
git add .

# Commit the changes with a meaningful message
git commit -m "feat: Solve two-sum problem in Python"

# Push the committed changes to the remote repository
git push origin main
```
